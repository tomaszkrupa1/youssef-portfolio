                        Who am I?

Hi! In 2021, I graduated from The University of Leeds with a first in Mathematics.

In February 2023, I completed the Northcoders full-time, 13-week software development bootcamp.

I'm at the start of my professional career. I'm looking for work that will allow me to develop both my technical and soft skills.

In the distant future, I wish to be an expert of my craft and a leader working towards making a positive change.

</p>
<br>
<p>
Strengths - drive, teamwork and problem solving
</p>
<br>
<p>
Values - compassion, integrity and development.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Some of my hobbies away from the screens are runnning, tennis, traveling and cooking.

                    My co and I were responsible for looking after 12 campers aged 13 during one session and 10 for the next.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I independently ran 3 classes of up to 18 campers such as soccer, pickle ball and kayaking each day. This massively improved my leadership and teaching skills. Also, I was a Redcross trained lifeguard.

                    Patience and empathy for some of the older customers was needed to be able to communicate with them effectively.

                <li>
                    My ability to learn sequences grew stronger as some of the tasks I needed to complete used software unfamiliar to me.

                    I travelled to Uganda to help four micro-entrepreneurs develop their businesses. This included: teaching basic business concepts, branding, finances, product development and pitching for a loan to a panel.

                    We were split into teams of three with two of us being from the UK and the other team member from Uganda. We worked as a superb team. By playing to each other’s strengths, managing work load fairly and being thoughtful when one of us was struggling consequently, our teamwork was phenomenal.

            <h4>Software Development Bootcamp</h4>
            <p>
                13-week intensive bootcamp designed to make its students work-ready software developers. By working with employers, the course is tailored to provide the skills you desire.
The course ensured we used fundamental concepts such as test-driven development, object-oriented programming and paired programming from the start, preparing us for a working environment.
In the back-end segment, we became familiar with asynchronous programming, RESTful APIs and Hosting databases. In the front-end segment, we learnt about the DOM, semantic HTML and responsive CSS. After each lecture we had the time to get hands on with what we had learnt via a sprint. I created a reddit style social news platform, linked below.
